## Abstract

Long-term studies of the presence and distribution of species within an ecosystem can provide an understanding of the health of that ecosystem over time, thus aiding researchers in assessing the necessity of conservation efforts for those species, and in determining the efficacy of previously implemented conservation efforts. For the past three years, students in the Geospatial Ecology Lab have been conducting breeding bird surveys at the MSUM Regional Science Center, and my goal is to conduct an exploratory data analysis to determine if any patterns have begun to emerge by looking at broad population movement in space and time, as well as patterns in behavior and habitat selection within individual species. Specifically, I will look at the distribution of the Black-billed Cuckoo and assess what environmental variables might affect its habitat selection, as this pertains directly to research that I will be conducting this summer. With only three years of data, it might be too soon to make any significant assumptions about longitudinal changes in populations, however I am hoping to get a good idea of the distribution of various species with regard to location, habitat, and the time of day/year they are most likely to be observed. Having this information will provide the basis for asking more specific research questions in the future, and beginning a broad analysis at this stage in the project can make it easier to make comparisons to future data about the state of the ecosystem at the Regional Science Center.

## Introduction
  ### cite some peer reviewed sources

## Methods

1. load packages and import data from excel sheets
2. join tables with common variable (point_id) to be able to make comparisons
        - points
        - surveys
        - observations
        - observer
        - species
    a. omit "bird sp." and "NA" from common name variable
    b. graphs to compare variables of interest
        - point id vs. species
        - species frequency
        - frequency of birds sighted at each point
3. Filter for year
    a. graphs
        - species frequency each year
        - point id vs species each year
4. Filter for black-billed cuckoo
    a. count
    b. graphs
        - black billed cuckoo point distribution
